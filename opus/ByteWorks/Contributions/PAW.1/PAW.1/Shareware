At the end of that time you are*          required to send the SHAREWARE fee to the address below,*          or to erase any copies of the disk that you may have.*          When I receive your SHAREWARE fee I will send you the*          latest version of the disk, including the source code*          files, and register you as a legitimate user. This will*          entitle you to support, notification of major updates*          and any suggestions you may have are much more likely*          to be acted on. Registered users are entitled to their*          first upgrade for free, and any further updates for $5.*          If you wish to upgrade to the 'Source Code Included'*          version at any time, the cost is simply the difference*          between the 'No Source' and 'Source Code Included' fees.**====================================================================**          The SHAREWARE fee for this disk is $25.00.**          The SHAREWARE fee if the source files are not required is $10.00.**====================================================================**          All files (other than ICON files) on this disk are:**                  Copyright 1988-2000 by Peter Watson.**          You may not sell these programs, or charge more than a*          reasonable copying fee for copying the disk.

Help to keep the SHARWARE concept*       alive and well in Australia by supporting this disk.**               Peter Watson*               P.O.
