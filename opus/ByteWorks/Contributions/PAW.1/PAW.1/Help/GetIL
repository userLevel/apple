GETIL deviceGet and report the interleave value and the number of sides on a 3.5" disk.Parameters:     device     Device name (e.g. .D1) of the device to format.  A volume                name may be used if the disk is a ProDOS disk.  You will                prompted if the parameter is omitted.Nb: This program should not fail, but will produce invalid results for devices    other than 3.5" disks.  Also, it uses an unsupported location to read    the interleave value.  It works on ROM 01 and ROM 03 machines.    It does *NOT* work using the Apple II 3.5 Disk Controller card!                Copyright by Peter Watson, May 1991.
