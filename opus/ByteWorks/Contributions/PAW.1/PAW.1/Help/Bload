BLOAD pathameThe specified file is loaded into memory, with all relocatable addressesbeing resolved.  The program displays the starting address of the loadedfile, then pauses to allow a Classic Desk Accessory such as NiftyList toexamine the file's code.  When the examination is finished, a keypressunloads the file again.  This program will run as a ProDOS 16 applicationif the filetype is changed to S16 ($B3).Parameters:     pathname   Full or partial pathname of the file you want to load.                The filename may include wildcards.WARNING: Due to a limitation of the ProDOS loader, if the loaded program=======  has an 'initialization' segment, it WILL be executed during the         load! (Even though the main program is not executed). The Shell         utility DUMPOBJ can be used to detect 'initialization' segments.Copyright by Peter Watson, January 1989.
