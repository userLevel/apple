SORT  [-D] [-N] [-C column]This program is a 'filter', which accepts input from standard input, andwrites it to standard output after sorting it in ascending order. The normalinput for this program will via input redirection.Parameters:        -D : Specifies a 'D'escending sort        -N : Specifies a 'N'umeric sort (ie. treat strings as numbers)        -C : Specifies the 'C'olumn in which to start sort comparisons.             Warning: The sort algorithm allows exchange of 'equal' lines!If the program appears to hang, it may be that the requested input file was notfound, so the program is waiting for input from the keyboard. Press 'Control-2'to escape from this situation.  (Blame Apple, it's their choice of key!).Examples :-   SORT <inputfile       <*** Cannot use wildcards for inputfile              CAT |SORT -d -c 21    <*** Show directory in descending file sizeDon't forget the spaces before the redirection characters ('<' and '|').Copyright March 1990 by Peter Watson
