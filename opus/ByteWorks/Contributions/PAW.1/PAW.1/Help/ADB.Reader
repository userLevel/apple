ADB.READER - Display the contents of an AppleWorks ADB (database) file,	     including any 'tag data' that is present.  An AppleWorks-like	     screen format is used to display the records.Syntax: ADB.Reader [-L] [-M] [-D] filename        -L = Display the category layout (before the normal records)        -M = Display the records in 'Multi Record Layout' format        -D = Tolerate DoubleData files (Nb: Can't display extra 30 categories!)	filename = The name of the AppleWorks ADB file.  The entire file		   will be loaded into memory, but this should not be a		   problem for anything but the most humungous files!		   The filename must be fully specified - wildcards are		   NOT supported.	There are several commands available while displaying the data.	These allow forwards and backwards movement through the file, switching	between 'single' and 'multi' record layout, and FIND'ing a text string.	Press <OpenApple>-? to see these commands.        Copyright by Peter Watson, September 1993
