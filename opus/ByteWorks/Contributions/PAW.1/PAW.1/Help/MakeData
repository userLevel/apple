Convert binary data in an input file to hex characters in an output file.Syntax :  MAKEDATA pathnameParameters:     pathname   Full or partial pathname of the file you want to process                The output filename is created by adding '.H' to the input nameEach input byte is written as TWO hexadecimal characters, prefixed by '0x' andseparated by commas. This allows them to be used as C array initializers.Fifteen input bytes are written to each output line (except perhaps the last).A prefix line will name the size of the data and the input file.Example:Input data:     0123456789AB...CDEF    (512 input bytes in file 'fred')        Output    :     /* Data from input file 'fred' * /                        char binData[512] = {                        0x01,0x23,0x45,0x67,0x89,0xAB,...,                        0xCD,0xEF                        };Copyright by Peter Watson, May 1993This program contains material from the ORCA/C Run-Time Libraries,copyright 1987-1992 by Byte Works, Inc.
