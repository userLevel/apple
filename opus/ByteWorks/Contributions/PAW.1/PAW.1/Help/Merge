MERGE pathname1 pathname2 [starting_offset]Merge one file 'over the top' of another, starting at a specified offset.Parameters:     pathname1       The full or partial pathname of the file to overlay.  This                     would usually be the shorter file.     pathname2       The full or partial pathname of the file to be overlaid.                     It will be created if it does not exist.     starting_offset The starting offset for the overlay.  It may be entered                     in decimal (123456), or in hexadecimal by entering a                     leading '$' sign (eg. $123fe). This offset may start                     past the original 'End-of-File'.                     The default is the End-of-File of the second file.Although the program 'overlays' the first file over the second, the numberof blocks allocated to the second file may increase, as it may have been a'sparse' file, with 'zero' blocks not actually written to disk.Copyright by Peter Watson, January 1991
