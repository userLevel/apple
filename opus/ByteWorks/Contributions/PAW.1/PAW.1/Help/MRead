MRead : Dump memory data in hex and ASCII to the screenSyntax: MREAD start_addr[.end_addr] [length] [-A] [-F[A] pathname]        'start_addr' - the address of the first byte to display        '.end_addr'  - the address of the last byte to disply        'length'     - number of bytes to display (overrides 'end_addr')                       Nb: Rounded *UP* to display a full line of data        -A           - ASCII display only, no hexadecimal        -F  pathname - Save raw data to a file instead of displaying it        -FA pathname - Append data to the end of a file        Addresses *must* be in hexadecimal. 'Length' defaults to decimal,        (but may be hexadecimal if prefixed by '$'), and defaults to        one line (16 bytes hex, 64 bytes ASCII).        An address in the form 'xxxx. ' will list until <Command-.> pressed.        The $Cxxx range is protected in banks $00, $01, $E0, and $E1.Examples: 'MREAD 1f000.1ffff' is the same as 'MREAD 1f000 $1000'          'MREAD 1f000. -a' displays ASCII data until <Command-.> is pressed.          'MREAD 1f000 $1000 -f save.file' saves two blocks of memory to disk.        Press any key to pause & resume the display. Press <Command-.> to exit.        Copyright by Peter Watson, October 1993.
