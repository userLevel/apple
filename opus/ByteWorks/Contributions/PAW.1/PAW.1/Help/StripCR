STRIPCRThis program is a 'filter', which accepts input from standard input, andechoes it to standard output.  It has one function - to replace carriagereturn characters with a space.  This allows merging several lines in atext file into one line.  One reason you may wish to do this is aftertrapping a list of files, to make them all parameters for a command thataccepts multiple parameters on one line (eg. DELETE).If '<Open-Apple>-.'  (Open Apple Period) is pressed, STRIPCR will terminate.If STRIPCR appears to hang, it may be that the requested input file was notfound, so the program is waiting for input from the keyboard.  To escape fromthis situation, press 'Control-2'.  (Blame Apple, it's their choice of key!).Examples :-  STRIPCR <inputfile >outputfile     ***Nb: Wildcards *NOT* allowed             TYPE inputfile |STRIPCR >outputfileDon't forget the spaces before the redirection characters ('<' and '|').Copyright February 1990 by Peter Watson
