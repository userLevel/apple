PURGE [-L][-A]This command displays, and optionally frees, all purgeable blocks from memory,compacting the remaining memory to give the largest possible contiguous block.The displayed information includes the size, location, attributes and pathnameof the "owning" program where possible, otherwise a generic "owner" is suppliedbased on the userid owning the block.PURGE also circumvents the problem of a program marked 'restartable' in theSYSCMND table (ie. '*U') being executed instead of a newly compiled version.Parameters:        -L      Lists the purgeable blocks only (Does NOT actually purge them)        -A      Lists ALL allocated blocks in memory (Does NOT purge them)Copyright by Mike Westerfield 1988, and by Peter Watson April 1989-1991.
