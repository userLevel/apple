TOGGLE slot [-B]This command toggles (ie. swaps) the slot definition in the IIgs Control Panelbetween the internal IIgs port and any card in the slot.The '-B' option causes an automatic system reBoot to be performed.Note that a reboot is required for the new slot definition to take effect.It is not automatic, as a safety measure, or because some other proceduremay be required to be executed first.Note: The '-B' option requires GS/OS to be the running operating system.Copyright by Peter Watson, May 1990.
