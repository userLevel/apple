FIXSOUND [pathname]This program modifies a digitized sound file from another computer systemsuch as the Macintosh so that it will run correctly on the IIgs.  It looksfor bytes containing $00 and converts them to $01 (a $00 in a sound filecauses the DOC chip to stop playing that portion of the sound).  Note thatnot every sound requires treatment, but most files sound considerably betterafter being 'fixed'.  Macintosh sound file headers and trailers will also beremoved, or the first sound resource will be extracted.  This program will runas a ProDOS 16 application if the filetype is changed to S16 ($B3).FIXSOUND will attempt to 'convert' any file it can 'see', including programs!Be careful if you use wildcards. GS/OS protects directories; LOCK other files.Parameters:     pathname   Full or partial pathname of the file you want to fix.                The filename may include wildcards.  If it is omitted,                you will be prompted for a pathname.Copyright by Peter Watson, December 1989.This program contains material from the ORCA/C Run-Time Libraries,copyright 1987-1989 by Byte Works, Inc.
