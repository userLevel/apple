PLAY [-C] [pathname] [speed]Loads and plays an uncompressed digitized sound file at the rate specified,or at a rate determined by the value of the file's AuxType field.  Note thatuncompressed Macintosh sound files work very well after 'FIXSOUND'ing them.   -C           Replay sound continuously until '<Open-Apple>-.' is pressed.   pathname     The full or partial pathname of the file to play. The filename                may include wildcards. If the pathname is omitted, you will                enter 'prompt' mode. In prompt mode, '\' as a pathname will                replay the most recent sound directly from memory. As well, the                default speed may be changed by entering '#Rate' as a pathname.   speed        The playback rate required. It may be entered in decimal                (0 - 4095), or in hexadecimal by entering a leading '$'                sign ($0 - $FFF).  If omitted, the AuxType of the file will                be used.  If AuxType is zero, then a rate of 428 is used.For unknown files, try playback rates of :- 428, 214, 312, 142 (in that order),based on a playback frequencies (or sampling rates) of 22, 11, 16, 7 KHz.PLAY is designed to be used under the APW or ORCA/M shells, but it will workcorrectly from the Finder if converted to filetype S16 ($B3). Or 'double-click'by using the PAW.ICONS file.            Copyright by Peter Watson, April 1989
