ONLINE  [M(ount)]This command displays all online devices that are known to GS/OS.The display includes information such as the internal or external slotthe device is in, the type of device, and the volume name (if appropriate).Non-ProDOS disk names will be displayed if the appropriate FST is present,however MSDOS and Macintosh HFS volumes will always have their name displayed.(You must have a drive capable of reading MFM-format to read MSDOS disks).If the 'M' (mount) parameter is specified, an attempt will be made to mount(that is, bring online) all offline SCSI volumes. This is particularly usefulfor removable devices such as Zip drives.If the filetype of the program is changed to S16 ($B3), then it can be executedfrom the Finder, where it will pause to allow reading the screen. However, inthis case the 'Mount' function is not available.Copyright by Peter Watson, 1988-1996
