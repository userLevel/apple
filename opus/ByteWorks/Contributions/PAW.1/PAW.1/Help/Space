SPACE [-O] [-Q] [-L] [-B] [pathname]Utility to determine the amount of space used within a directory and allsub-directories.Parameters:   -O         Scan 'O'nly the specified directory (no sub-directories).   -Q         Suppress processing messages ('Q'uiet mode).   -L         'L'ist the space (including any sub-directories) and file count              (*NOT* including sub-directories) for each directory processed.              Under the Finder, this option is automatically activated.   -B         Only count files with 'B'ackup bit set (Always count directories!)   pathname   The full or partial pathname of the file to play. The filename              may include wildcards. If the pathname is omitted, you will be              prompted for a filename. Pressing <return> alone will exit.Pressing '<Open-Apple>-.' at any time will abandon the space calculation.Note: If calculating the space of a 'volume' directory, don't forget to add in      the space set aside for the directory itself, and the volume bitmap.  On      a floppy disk, you would add 7 blocks to the total space reported, which      would then equal the total space used as reported by a 'CATALOG'.Copyright 1989-1995 by Peter Watson.
