STRIPLF [pathname]This program modifies a text file (often from another computer system) byremoving any <LF> bytes (ie. Line Feed characters, $0A).STRIPLF will run as a ProDOS 16 application from the Finder if the filetypeis changed to S16 ($B3).STRIPLF will attempt to process any file it is given, including programs!Be careful if you use wildcards. GS/OS will protect directories, and youcan LOCK other files.Parameters:     pathname   Full or partial pathname of the file you want to process.                The filename may include wildcards.  If it is omitted,                you will be prompted for a pathname.Copyright by Peter Watson, January 1990.This program contains material from the ORCA/C Run-Time Libraries,copyright 1987-1989 by Byte Works, Inc.
