SHUTDOWN [-C] [-R]This command closes all files and ejects any disks in drives,then executes the GS/OS 'OS_SHUTDOWN' command.  This finishes anyoutstanding I/O, then displays a dialogue telling the user it issafe to power down. There is also an option to restart the system.The '-C' option causes GS/OS to perform a 'Cold start', which completelyresets the system to a power-up state.  For example, it activates anychanges to the size of the RAM Disk.The '-R' option causes GS/OS to automatically restart after the shutdown,bypassing the usual 'Power down or Restart' dialogue.Note: SHUTDOWN requires GS/OS to be the running operating system.Copyright by Peter Watson, November 1989 - April 1995.
