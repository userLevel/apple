MOREThis program is a 'filter', which accepts input from standard input, andechoes it to the screen.  Control characters will be highlighted. Aftereach 22 lines of output, the program will pause and display the message[More]and wait for a keypress, after which the program will continue.If '<Open-Apple>-.'  (Open Apple Period) is pressed, the program willterminate.  If the program appears to hang, it may be that the requestedinput file was not found, so the program is waiting for input from thekeyboard.  Press 'Control-2' to escape from this situation. (Blame Apple,it's their choice of key!).Examples :-     MORE < inputfile        <*** Cannot use wildcards for inputfile                TYPE inputfile | MOREDon't forget the spaces before the redirection characters ('<' and '|').Copyright April 1989 by Peter Watson
