The programs in the directory named PAW.1 have been made available for inclusion on the compilation CD produced by the Byte Works, Inc. There is also a ShrinkIt archive containing the contents of the PAW.1 directory to simplify copying to a IIgs if required.The programs are mostly ORCA command shell utilities. Some programs can be executed from the Finder (they will sometimes need to have the filetype converted to S16), where they will prompt for a filename. Check the Read.Me and help files (found in the Help directory) for details. The programs will (mostly) work with the ProSel and GNO/ME command shells, although wildcards will not be supported.Please read the Read.Me file!Although the Read.Me and Sharware files still refer to the programs being shareware, I am now releasing these programs as freeware!Please note that I still retain copyright on these programs, and they may not be sold on a commercial basis. Users groups and entities such as Joe Kohn's Shareware Solutions II may distribute these programs (but not the source code) for a reasonbable copying fee.The source code is available on the source CD. It may be used and modified for personal use.Modified programs (whether created from the source code or by editing the files) must not be distributed without prior approval from Peter Watson.Peter Watson, October 29, 2000.
