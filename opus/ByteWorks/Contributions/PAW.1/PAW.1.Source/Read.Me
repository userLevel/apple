Also, many of themwill execute correctly directly from the Finder or any other ProDOS (or GS/OS)program launcher, if the filetype is changed from EXE to S16 using the included'FILETYPE' utility. There are also a number of utilities written for Applesoft(on //e, //c and IIgs) and GSBasic BASIC, and several classic desk accessories.Currently three utilities require GS/OS - 'ONLINE', 'SHUTDOWN' and 'SPACE'.                          =======Also, the NULL device driver is only usable under GS/OS.Utilities accessing resource data will require GS/OS for that function only.(eg. DUMP, or TOGGLE (for the ShutDown option))The majority of the programs in the UTILS directory may be 'paused' bypressing (almost) any key, and 'cancelled' by pressing <Open-Apple><.>,(Open-Apple-Period). If processing multiple files with wildcards in 'DUMP'and 'PLAY', then this will simply advance to the next file. Press <Option><.>to cancel out of the program entirely.The program disk contains the following directories:ASOFT           Utilities written in (or used under) Applesoft BASIC.DA              Desk Accessories (CDAs and/or NDAs). You must copy them to the                SYSTEM/DESK.ACCS directory on your 'system disk' and restart                the computer.DRIVERS         Device driver(s). You must copy them to the SYSTEM/DRIVERS                directory on your 'system disk' and restart the computer for                them to be available.EXECS           Useful or required APW EXEC files.GSBASIC         Utilities written in GSBasic. In general, they should be                usable with the TML BASIC compiler with minor modifications.                The files are also included as text files for TML BASIC users,                but the line numbers will have to be removed first.HELP            Help files for many of the programs, the remainder being                documented below. Note that help files have been added for the                built-in commands 'COMPRESS' and 'SWITCH', which were omitted                from APW due to an error by Apple. All that needs to be done to                activate these commands is to add the appropriate entries to                the SYSTEM/SYSCMND command table (see the SYSCMND.SAMPLE file).                The help files are specifically written for the APW / ORCA shell                environment, but they generally apply to running from the Finder                although wildcards are not available, and if the program does                not prompt you, then you may not be able to enter options.ICONS           Icon files - both for my programs, and for others that I am                providing just so people will have icons if they get data files.                PAW.ICONS should contain all the icons I have created (using                David Lyon's shareware utility 'DIcEd'), but to override some                of the Finder defaults, I had to merge them with FINDER.ICONS.SOURCE          Source code and macros for the programs in the UTILS directory.                The files have been compressed into a self-extracting archive                using ShrinkIt GS. Simply run the program to extract the files                to a separate disk, normally named /PAW.1.Source.                The files are in ORCA/M or APW format. (ORCA/M includes a                file detailing macro differences between APW and ORCA/M).                Note that these files are only present on the disk sent to                REGISTERED users who have paid the source code fee.UTILS           The majority of the actual utility programs. Some of the                utilities still prompt for missing parameters by using the                text tool '_ReadLine' toolbox call. This is a simple call,                with one major flaw - it does not support Delete or backspace!                If you realise you have made a mistake, press the Delete key                anyway, then press the Return key. This will cause a parameter                'syntax error', and you will be prompted again. The more                recent programs use my READLN subroutine to provide support                for backspace, Delete and Escape. Note that with most                programs, if you are prompted for a parameter and you simply                press Return, the program will exit.SYSCMND.SAMPLE  This is a sample SYSCMND file for ORCA/APW, which would normally                be merged with the existing SYSTEM/SYSCMND file. Most of the                files have been marked as restartable (ie. '*U' instead of 'U').SAMPLE.SOUND    A sample digitized sound file for use by PLAY.The source disk (after extracting from the compressed archive file) containsthe following directories:ASM             Source code and macros for the programs in the UTILS directory.                The files are in ORCA/M or APW format. (ORCA/M includes a                file detailing macro differences between APW and ORCA/M).CC              Source code in APW C or ORCA/C format for utilities written in                'C'. There is also a library file containing the compiled                versions of the 'include' files contained in the ASM directory.Note that these files are only present on the disk sent to REGISTERED users whohave paid the source code fee.Details of utilities with no separate help file.------------------------------------------------ASCII.CDA       A CDA to display the ASCII character set (including MouseText                characters). This CDA works under ProDOS 8, ProDOS 16 and GS/OS.BASIC           This APW (or ORCA/M) EXEC file is required to use the BASICX                program. See the help file for BASIC.BASICX          An APW (or ORCA/M) utility used in conjunction with the BASIC                EXEC file mentioned above. See the help file for BASIC.BAS.TO.GSB      This GSBASIC utility will read an Applesoft BASIC program and                perform some initial conversion of statements into GSBASIC (or                TML BASIC) format, where possible. The output file may be                specified as .CONSOLE to simply list the conversion. Note that                the program creates a text file which must be EXEC'ed into                memory and then saved (or compiled under TML BASIC).BOOTMAKER       This ProDOS 8 BINary utility will write boot blocks (that is,                blocks 0 and 1) onto any device that has already been formatted                This can be useful in several cases. For example, most RAM                disks will automatically be usable without the user explicitly                formatting them. If you wish to boot from the RAM disk at some                later time after copying files to the disk, then this utility                will save the necessity of formatting the disk and recopying                the files. Another example is that GS/OS has changed the boot                blocks. The public domain utility (BLK0CHECK), used to check                for a virus damaging block 0, assumes that a GS/OS formatted                disk has been corrupted, and will not allow you to reboot. Or                it may be simply that the boot blocks on a disk have been                corrupted by a runaway program. Note that BOOTMAKER assumes                the disk to be repaired is the first drive in a slot (the only                drive you can boot from!). A future version of this program                will support GS/OS boot blocks (which at present do not appear                to be any different in function to the current blocks).BOOTMAKER.GSOS  The updated version of BOOTMAKER which writes the GS/OS boot-                blocks. Note that they 'should' still work with ProDOS 8 on                a //e or //c, but I haven't tested that. You can now update                drive/unit 2 by holding down the Open-Apple key while selecting                the slot.COLOR640        A simple Quickdraw II application to display the 16 default                colours available with 640-mode dithered colours. The colours                are numbered 0 to 15, from top-left to bottom-right.COMPARE         This GSBASIC utility will compare two text files line-by-line.                Lines that do not match will be displayed with the differences                highlighted. When a difference is found, several options are                available. These include the ability to skip a record on                either of the input files, or to attempt to find two matching                records by reading forward. This utility is very useful to                work out the differences between two version of source code,                or between an old and a new parameter file.DIV.INC         Fast integer division routine. Enter in full native mode to                divide Y by X. Answer in Acc, remainder in Y, carry set if X=0.FILETYPE        This Applesoft BASIC utility allows you to easily change the                filetype of a ProDOS file. You may enter the new filetype in                decimal, hexadecimal (precede the value with '$') or by entering                the ASCII mnemonic (eg. BAS, TXT, S16, EXE, etc). Note that                the program will only work with Smartport type drives (ie. 3.5"                disks, RAMcards or SCSI hard disks). The file FILETYPE.BIN is                required to issue the necessary disk commands.FIXCDA          A tiny program which restores the CDA menu if it has been                disabled by a 'protected' program, such as 'Tass Times in Tone                Town'. The annoying thing is not that it is disabled while                the program is running, but that it is not restored when the                program quits. Now all you have to do is run FIXCDA.HOLD.CDA        A CDA to blank the screen and display a moving Apple to prevent                screen burnout. Exit by any keyboard or mouse activity. Note                that it is not based on lack of activity - you must explicitly                activate the program. (I HATE my screen blanking by itself!)                This CDA works under ProDOS 8, ProDOS 16 and GS/OS.GOTOXY.INC      An assembler routine to move the cursor to a given screen                location given in the X and Y registers. Used (will be used)                by several programs in the future. Note that it works best if                the cursor is turned off (by printing a $06 character). See                'GOTOXY' in PAW.LIB.LLIST           This is an Applesoft program saved in text format to be used by                issuing an 'EXEC LLIST' command with a program to be printed in                memory. It will append itself as line 0 to the front of the                program. If RUN, it will prompt for a title, then list the file                to an ImageWriter printer attached to slot 1. Long lines will                be wrapped correctly, and page breaks will be skipped.LPRINT          This APW (or ORCA/M) EXEC file will send a file to the printer                with any remaining parameters (after the file name) being                printed along with filename itself at the head of the print.                eg. 'LPRINT Play.1 31 February 2001' would begin as follows:                'File Play.1 - 31 February 2001', followed by a blank line.                At the end, a prompt allows issuing of one or more formfeeds to                the printer. Nb: A (printer?) problem means you should wait                until printing finishes as formfeeds cause data to be lost.LODEVIRUSFIND   This Applesoft BASIC program will check a disk for the presence                of the 'Lode Runner' virus. Note that this virus infects the                boot blocks of a disk, and then installs itself in memory in                such a way that it survives a 'cold start' (ie. <Open-Apple>                <Control><Reset>)! To defeat this virus, you must rewrite                the boot-blocks using a utility such as BOOTMAKER, or by                copying the files to another disk then initializing the                'infected' disk. You *MUST* then TURN OFF THE COMPUTER to                guarantee the virus is removed from memory, *BEFORE* booting                any other disk using <Open-Apple><Control><Reset>.MASS.FORMAT     This Applesoft BASIC utility allows you to easily format an                entire box (or more) of 3.5" disks. If you have two drives,                it automatically swaps drives without prompting. You can                enter any interleave value, eg. 2:1 for GS/OS or 4:1 for ProDOS                8. The default is 2:1. The file FORMAT.DATA is needed to write                boot blocks and an empty directory onto the disk (all the disks                will be named /BLANKx, where 'x' is the interleave value). Note                that this program also demonstrates a method to find data files                in the called program's directory, and how to eject 3.5" disks.MULT8.INC       Fast 8-bit integer multiplication routine. Enter in full                native mode to multiply Acc by X. Answer in Acc, X destroyed.                Overflow is *NOT* detected!NULL            A 'dummy' device driver which is useful to create an 'extra'                device to test programs with, or to use as a 'bit bucket' for                for suppressing command output under APW. It looks like a 64K                ROM disk named /NULL containing one file named NULL. You can                write or format the disk forever - nothing will happen. If you                read from it, blocks 2 (the directory) and 6 (the bit map) will                return valid information. All other blocks will return 512                bytes of zeroes. This includes the file /NULL/NULL. An example                of suppressing output would be:  ASML myprog >/NULL/NULLPQUIT           A short Applesoft BASIC program which demonstrates how to                execute a ProDOS 16 (GS/OS) program from BASIC, presuming that                ProDOS 16 or GS/OS had been booted originally.PAW.LIB         A library file containing pre-assembled routines used by several                programs on this disk, and perhaps useful within your own. Note                that the routines have UPPER-CASE names! (Important in 'C'.)                Currently contains: STOP_PAUSE, READLN, SHOWACC, GOTOXY, MULT8,                DIV.PFSEXT          A shell utility to extract the data records from the original                Pascal-based version of the PFS database program. The utility                requires two parameters: the device number of the 5.25" drive                containing the PFS data disk, and the path name for the output                file. Enter PFSEXT without parameters for two other parameters.                Based on a 1986 Applesoft program written by Jim Luther.PICDUMP.CDA     A CDA to dump the Super Hi-Res screen (320 or 640 mode) to disk                as a 65 block $C1 (PIC) file, which can then be loaded into all                paint packages. The saved file will be called SCREEN.00. If                SCREEN.0 exists, then SCREEN.01 will be created, and so on up to                SCREEN.99. No messages are displayed - errors will simply cause                a beep. This CDA works under ProDOS 8, ProDOS 16 and GS/OS.PRINT.TEXT      A BASIC program to print one or all text files in a directory to                the screen or printer. Useful to print copies of the various                documentation files on this disk. It supports TXT and SRC files.                This program has some interesting subroutines for scrolling                menu selection, and dynamically vetting BASIC input. It was                originally written to display the documentation and help files                on this disk.QUIT.TO.GSOS    A short routine which restores the "normal" GS/OS or ProDOS 16                'QUIT' code which returns to GS/OS. This is intended to be used                 when running ProDOS 8 under GS/OS, and the QUIT routine gets                replaced or damaged by another program selector (eg. Squirt,                Bird's Better Bye or the WINDOWS program from 'A2 Central').                Simply execute the program, then QUIT to ProDOS in the normal                way, such as issuing the 'BYE' command from BASIC.READLN.INC      An assembler program segment to read a line from the standard                input, including basic editing support and the <Esc> key. Used                by several programs (more to come) to replace Apple's primitive                '_ReadLine' toolbox call. See 'READLN' in PAW.LIB.SHOWACC.INC     An assembler program segment to display the contents of the                Accumulator on the screen, eg. '$0001' or '$1234'. I normally                only use this routine for debugging, for which it is friendly                and convenient (especially since it saves ALL registers and                memory width, etc). It *does* assume native mode and that a                'writestr' will write to the screen! Called by 'JSL ShowAcc'.                See 'ShowAcc' in PAW.LIB.SHOW.TIME       A short Applesoft BASIC program which demonstrates how to                access the IIgs clock to display the time and date on the screen                with minimal effort, accurate to the second.STOP.PAUSE.INC  An assembler program segment to check the keyboard for the                Open-Apple (or Option) and Period combination by the user                requesting the termination of the current task. Based on an                example in the APW Assembler Reference manual. Used by several                programs on this disk. See 'STOP_PAUSE' in PAW.LIB.                (Updated to STOP_PAUSE2 - displays hourglass while pausing)SMARTPORT       This Applesoft BASIC utility displays details about any device                attached to a //e, //c or IIgs using the Smartport interface.                This includes UniDisk 3.5 interface cards, most SCSI interface                cards, the Apple II Memory Expansion card and the IIgs slot 5                Smart Port. You can also reset the Smartport using this                program. Press '?' at any prompt for help. This program uses                an interesting way of documenting the combination of machine                code in an Applesoft program.UNNEW           This binary file is designed to run under Applesoft BASIC with                either ProDOS or DOS 3.3. It is designed to recover a program                that is lost due to an accidental NEW (or FP under DOS 3.3)                command. It can occasionally succeed in recovering from other                errors which make the program in memory mysteriously disappear.                Any time that LIST fails to display a program, simply enter                BRUN UNNEW, then immediately save the program under a new name.                Reload the program from disk (important!), and test it out                before overwriting any previous versions.*=================================================================* Release Notes*=================================================================V1.00 - 4th February 1989        Initial releaseV1.01 - PAW.ICONS file fixed, and FINDER.ICONS deleted as unnecessary.      - Delete BOOTVOL.      - Add sample sound file (Help! by the Beatles).*=================================================================V1.10 - 20th February 1989        Add BEEP command.        Add READLN.INC and STOP.PAUSE.INC to source code.        Add FILETYPE and LLIST Basic programs.        Update DUMP to v2.1.*=================================================================V1.20 - 12th March 1989        Add UNNEW Basic program.        Update MASS.FORMAT to v3.02.        Update DUMP to v2.2.
