DiskMaker 1.0Copyright 2000 Eric ShepherdThis software is Shareware.  If you find it useful, please pay the $10 shareware fee.  See the information at the end of this documentation for details on how to do this.  $5 to help ensure further Apple II development is hardly a major price to pay.What Is It?DiskMaker is a utility for the Apple IIgs computer that lets you take disk image files and write them out as complete disks, right on your Apple IIgs.  DiskMaker supports all the same filetypes supported by ImageMaker — raw, DiskCopy 4.2, DiskCopy 6, and Universal Disk Image (.2mg).You can use DiskMaker to restore disks from images whether they were created on a Mac using DiskCopy, or using an emulator such as Sweet16 or Bernie ][ The Rescue.DiskMaker requires System 6.0.1.Using DiskMakerIf you have disk image files you want to convert, you can simply double-click them (assuming their filetypes are correct; DiskMaker should be launched automatically if the files have the correct Apple IIgs or Macintosh file types).Otherwise you can launch DiskMaker yourself and select a disk image file from the Standard File dialog box that appears on your screen.  This dialog box lists all files, not just ones that are obviously disk images (to make it easier when bringing disk images over from other computers), so be careful what file you select!Next, a dialog box will appear listing the disks you have online.  Select the disk to which you want to write the image file.  You should also make sure the image file format in the popup menu at the bottom of the screen matches the format of the image file you’re converting.  If the file’s type information is correct, this should already be set, but otherwise you should override this option.If you decide you don’t want to make the disk after all, click the Skip button.  If you launched DiskMaker by opening a group of files in the Finder, you’ll be asked where you want to write the next disk.  Otherwise DiskMaker will quit.When you’ve selected the target disk and have confirmed that the image file format is correct, click the Make Disk button.If the target disk has already been formatted, an alert will ask you to confirm overwriting the disk.  If the disk hasn’t been formatted, it will be formatted for you automatically.A status window will show a thermometer indicating the progress of writing the disk.Note: The DiskCopy 4.2 format uses a checksum that causes making disks from these images to take a lot longer than with other image file formats.Quitting DiskMakerOnce an image is converted, you’ll be returned to the image selection Standard File dialog box.  Click Cancel to quit DiskMaker.Registering DiskMakerThis software is fully-functional.  However, if you find it useful, please pay the US $10 shareware fee.
