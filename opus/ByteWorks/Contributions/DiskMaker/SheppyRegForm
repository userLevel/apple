If you don't have an email address, or want a printed receipt, you can get one for an extra $1.00; put "1" in the Quantity column next to Postcard Receipt and add $1.00 to your total.If you're ordering gsAIM, and already have a copy, please write your gsAIM serial number (found in the "Please Register" dialog box) where indicated.  This will speed up the registration process.  If you don't include the serial number, a copy will be mailed to you on disk, and you'll then have to provide the serial number by email to sheppy@sheppyware.net to unlock it.
