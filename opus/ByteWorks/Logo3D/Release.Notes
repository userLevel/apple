3D Logo 1.0.2Copyright 1993, Byte Works, Inc.--- A big thanks... -----------------------------------------------------------...to those of you who took the time to report problems you found in 3D Logo 1.0.  The time you took paid off for all of us when these bugs were fixed in this version.I've tried to give credit to the person who reported each bug by naming them below.  If I missed amyone, I'm truly sorry.Mike Westerfield--- Changes made in 3D Logo 1.0.2 ---------------------------------------------1.  Corrected a spelling error in the installer scripts (Chemestry -> Chemistry).  Note:  The version number of 1.0.2 refers to the disk version.  The version number for the executable file is still 1.0.1.--- Changes made in 3D Logo 1.0.1 ---------------------------------------------1.  An invalid parameter to FORWARD was reported as an error to BACK.2.  "Didn't" was spelled "Did't" in an error message.3.  Wrap mode did not work properly with windows that were smaller than thephysical screen.(Ernie Moye, Jr.)4.  SetPenSize did not work proerly in wrap mode.(Ernie Moye, Jr.)5.  FILL did not work in 640 mode.(Ernie Moye, Jr.)6.  Desktop commands (like NEWWINDOW) caused problems when they were usedoutside of a desktop program -- they are now blocked, flagging an error, ifthey are used outside of a desktop program.(Ernie Moye, Jr.)7.  An infinitely recursive program, like	TO t	t	ENDwould crash.  It now exits gracefully with an error.(Ernie Moye, Jr.)8.  The statement	WORD 1 2was generating an error ("WORD doesn't like 1 as input).  It now accepts thenumbers, returning "12.(George LeCompte)        9.  Some parenthesized statements, like	(PRINT "a "b "c)generated the incorrect error:  I don't know how to )(George LeCompte)10.  Binary math operations did not accept numeric words.  For example,	PR 1 + "2is legal, and now returns 3.(R.W.W. Taylor)11.  Numbers starting with a decimal point, like .8, are now accepted.(R.W.W. Taylor)12.  Numbers with an exponent, but no decimal point, like 3e3, are nowaccepted.(R.W.W. Taylor)13.  LOWERCASE 4 is a legal statement, but was not accepted.(R.W.W. Taylor)14.  Spurious errors were generated for the statement	pr :r(where :r is undefined).(R.W.W. Taylor)15.  Saving a movie or turtle window did not mark it as unchanged, so youstill got a prompt asking if it should be saved if you immediately closed thewindow.16.  The ERN command was case sensitive; it should not be.(R.W.W. Taylor)17.  Setting the font family with SETFONTFAMILY did not work unless you also set the size of the font using SETFONTSIZE.  If you set the family without setting the size, you now get a default size of 12.(George LeCompte)18.  SetPos did not reset the text position when the turtle position did not change.  For example,   TurtleIO   SetPos [0 0]   Print "123   SetPos [0 0]   Print "1234should print the second string on top of the first, but it did not.(Steve Fortin)19.  The Mouse command did not use the scrunch factor.  The most obvious result of this bug was returning invalid X coordinates in 640 mode.(Ernie Moye, Jr.)20.  Member and MemberP did not work in many situations.(George LeCompte)21.  Printing a procedure whose listing includes the empty set printed the empty set with an extra set of brackets.  Symbolically, [] was printing as [[]].(Dave Pierce)22.  A fairly common error for people who have used other languages is to type	:z = 3The error message that was reported was not correct.(RWW Taylor)23.  You can now use reserved words as the names for variables, parameters and property lists.  This is more in keeping with the tradition established by other Logo interpreters.24.  On rare occasions, Logo would drop a symbol.  This generally occurred when the result of a user procedure was used as an input to a command like LPut, which built a list, and when automatic garbage collection happened to occur while the list was being built.(RWW Taylor)25.  Blank lines inside a procedure caused an error.  They are now legal, and can be used to make it easier to read the procedure.(GSPlusDiz)
