Marinetti v2.0by Richard BennettReleased: 27th September 1998Copyright (c) 1996-1998 by Richard BennettWelcome to version 2.0 of Marinetti. A lot of work has been put into this release over the last twelve months or so, so much so that I consider this almost a brand new product.To install Marinetti, run the enclosed application “Marinetti.2.0”. It will guide you through the installation. Once you’ve done that, make sure you read the entire “Marinetti.DOC” file, because there is quite a lot of information you’ll need to know before getting Marinetti to work.I’m sorry, but due to the expected traffic, all Marinetti related email to me will be ignored. Delphi and Genie contact information is available in the “Marinetti.DOC” file.Extra warm hellos to everyone on Genie and Delphi, especially those who attended KFest ’98.This release is for all those who successfully registered for version 1.0. Unbelievably, there were exactly 100 of you. You wouldn’t believe how many idiots out there just couldn’t figure out how to register.Richard BennettAuthor of Marinetti
