MACGEN [+C|-C] [-P] file outfile macrofilesFile is the name of an assembly language source file.  The utility scansfile, producing a list of all of the macros used in the program.  The macrofiles listed in the third parameter are then scanned for needed macros.  Ifall needed macros are not found, the utility prompts for more.  The macrofile is written to outfile.  The search stops when all macros have been foundor the RETURN key is used when a macro file is requested.Normally, the generated macro file has all excess spaces removed to savespace.  If -C is specified, the excess spaces are not removed.It is safe to use outfile as one of the macro files to search.Parameters:     +C|-C      Crunch macros flag.     -P         Supress copyright message.     file       Source file to scan.     outfile    Output file name.     macrofiles One or more macro files to search for macros.
