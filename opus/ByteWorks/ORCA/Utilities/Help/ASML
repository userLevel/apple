If the maximum error level found is not overthe maximum error level allowed, the object module is linked.  There areseveral ways to set the output file names - see the reference manual fordetails.  For details about language dependent parameters, see the referencemanual.This command is functionally equivalent to CMPL.Parameters:     file1 ...  Source files to assemble.     +B         Create a bank-relative program.     -C         Inhibit compaction of the executable file.     +D -D      Debug on/off flag.     +E -E      Exit to editor on terminal error flag.     -I         (C only) Ignore any symbol file, and don't create one.     +L -L      Source listing output flag.     +M -M      Compile to memory flag.     +O -O      (Compilers only) Optimize code or inhibit optimizations.     +P -P      Turn progress information on or off.     -R         (C only) Rebuild the symbol file.     +S -S      Symbol table output flag.     +T -T      Treat all errors as terminal errors flag.     +W -W      Pause listing on error flag.     -X         Inhibit creation of an express header for the executable file.     KEEP=      Saves the finished program to outfile.     NAMES=()   Only the named subroutines are assembled.
