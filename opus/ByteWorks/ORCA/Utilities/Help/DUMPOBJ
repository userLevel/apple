DUMPOBJ [+X] [+D] [-H] [-S] [-O] [-F] [-A] [-M] [-I] [-L] file        [NAMES=(s1 s2...)]Writes the contents of an object module to the standard output.  Three majorformats are available.  By default, the file is dumped as object moduleoperation codes and operands.  A hex dump or 65816 disassembly is alsopossible.  Several minor variations can also be selected with the switches.Parameters:     +X         Dump the file in hex format.     +D         Dump the file in 65816 native source code format.     -H         Don't show headers.     -S         Write short headers instead of long ones.     -O         Suppress the body of the object module, printing the header                only.     -F         Suppress file type check - allows the use of any file type.     -A         Don't show the address and displacement fields.     -M         Assume short memory registers for disassembled listing.     -I         Assume short index registers for disassembled listing.     -L         Don't list the body of long constant op codes.     (s1 s2...) List if specific segments to dump.  If omitted, all segments                are dumped.     file       The name of the file to dump.
