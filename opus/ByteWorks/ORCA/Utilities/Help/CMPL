CMPL [+B] [-C] [+D|-D] [+E|-E] [-I] [+L|-L] [+M|-M] [+O|-O] [+P|-P] [-R]   [+S|-S] [+T|-T] [+W|-W] [-X] file1 ... [KEEP=outfile]   [NAMES=(sub1 [sub2] ...)]The source files are compiled.  If the maximum error level found is not overthe maximum error level allowed, the object module is linked.  There areseveral ways to set the output file names - see the reference manual fordetails.  For details about language dependent parameters, see the referencemanual.This command is functionally equivalent to ASML.Parameters:     file1 ...  Source files to compile.     +B         Create a bank-relative program.     -C         Inhibit compaction of the executable file.     +D -D      Debug on/off flag.     +E -E      Exit to editor on terminal error flag.     -I         (C only) Ignore any symbol file, and don't create one.     +L -L      Source listing output flag.     +M -M      Compile to memory flag.     +O -O      (Compilers only) Optimize code or inhibit optimizations.     +P -P      Turn progress information on or off.     -R         (C only) Rebuild the symbol file.     +S -S      Symbol table output flag.     +T -T      Treat all errors as terminal errors flag.     +W -W      Pause listing on error flag.     -X         Inhibit creation of an express header for the executable file.     KEEP=      Saves the finished program to outfile.     NAMES=()   Only the named subroutines are compiled.
