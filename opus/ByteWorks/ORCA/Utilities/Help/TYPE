TYPE [-A] [+N|-N] [+T|-T] file1 [n1 [n2]] [file2 [n1 [n2]]]...File is typed to the current output device.  If the +N switch is used,each line typed is preceded by a line number; the switch defaults to -N.N1 and n2 are line numbers.  If n1 is specified, all lines up to n1 areskipped.  If n2 is specified, the lines after it are skipped.  Multipleinput files can be specified - in that case, they are typed one afteranother.Normally, TYPE will only write printable ASCII characters, carriage returns,line feeds and form feeds to the output device.  If non-printing charactersshould be written (perhaps to set the screen to inverse) use the -A flag.Normally, TYPE will expand any tab characters, replacing the tab characterwith an appropriate number of spaces.  If the -T flag is used, tabs are not expanded.Parameters:     -A         Allow non-ASCII characters.     +N -N      Controls the use of line numbers.     +T -T      Controls whether tabs are expanded.     file1      File to type.     file2      Next file to type, and so on.     n1         First line number to list.     n2         Last line number to list.
