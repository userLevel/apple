INIT [-C] device [FST] [name]The disk is initialized.  If name is specified, the new volume is given thatname; otherwise, BLANK is used.If the disk has already been formatted, the INIT command normally double-checksto be sure you want to reinitialize the disk.  If the -C flag is used, the INITcommand does not double-check before initializing the volume.By default, the ProDOS FST format is used.  You can override this default byspecifying an FST by number.  Of course, GS/OS must support the FST numberyou select.Parameters:     -C         Don't check before initializing the disk.     device     Device number (i.e. .D1) of the device to initialize.  A volume                name may be used if the disk has already been initialized.     FST        File System Translator number.     name       Name to assign to the new disk.
