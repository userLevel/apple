COMPILE [+D|-D] [+E|-E] [-I] [+L|-L] [+M|-M] [+O|-O] [+P|-P] [-R] [+S|-S]   [+T|-T] [+W|-W] file1 ... [KEEP=outfile] [NAMES=(sub1 [sub2] ...)]   [language=(option)]The source files are compiled.  There are several ways to set the output filenames - see the reference manual for details.  For details about languagedependent parameters, see the reference manual.This command is functionally equivalent to ASSEMBLE.Parameters:     +D -D      Debug on/off flag.     +E -E      Exit to editor on terminal error flag.     -I         (C only) Ignore any symbol file, and don't create one.     +L -L      Source listing output flag.     +M -M      Compile to memory flag.     +O -O      (Compilers only) Optimize code or inhibit optimizations.     +P -P      Turn progress information on or off.     -R         (C only) Rebuild the symbol file.     +S -S      Symbol table output flag.     +T -T      Treat all errors as terminal errors flag.     +W -W      Pause listing on error flag.     file1 ...  Source files to compile.     KEEP=      Saves the finished program to outfile.     NAMES=()   Only the named subroutines are compiled.     language=(option)   Passes a language-dependent option list to the                assembler or compiler.
