COPY [-C] [-D] [-F] [-P] [-R] file1 <file2>File1 is copied from its current location to the location specified by file2.If file2 is not specified, the current prefix is used.  If file2 is adirectory, the current file name is used.  If it is not, file2 is assumed tobe a new file name.If file1 is a directory, all of the files in the directory are copied to file2.If directories are contained within the directory being copied, all of thefiles in that directory are also copied.  New directories are created as neededto copy all of the files.If the -C flag is set, existing files that get in the way of the copy aredeleted without prompting.  If the -C flag is not specified, the system givesyou a chance to rename the file or not copy it.The -D flag specifies that an entire disk is to be copied.By default, both the data fork and the resource fork of a file are copied.  Ifthe -R flag is used, only the resource fork is copied.  If the -F flag is used,only the data fork is copied.Parameters:     -C         Don't check before deleting files.     -D         Do a full disk copy.     -F         Copy only the data fork.     -R         Copy only the resource fork.     -P         Suppress progress information.     file1      File to copy.     file2      Location to copy to.
