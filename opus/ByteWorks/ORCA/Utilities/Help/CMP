CMP [-L] [-S] [-V] file1 file2Compares file1 to file2.  If the files are identical, a message to that affectis printed, and the return code is zero.  If one file is longer than theother, but all characters up to the end of the shorter file match, anappropriate message is printed, and the return code is set to one.  If thefiles differ, the utility writes the displacement of the difference, first indecimal and then in hexadecimal, and then the bytes that differ, with the bytefrom file1 appearing first.  The return code is then set to one, and theutility exits.  If an error occurs, such as a file name error or a user abort,the return code is set to -1.There must be enough memory to hold both files in memory at one time.Parameters:     -L         Print all differences, not just the first one.     -S         Don't print anything - sets return code only.     -V         Prints the copyright notice and version number.     file1      First file to compare.     file2      Second file to compare.
