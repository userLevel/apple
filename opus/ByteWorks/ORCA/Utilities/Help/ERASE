ERASE [-C] device [FST] [name]Erase a disk.  If name is specified, the new volume is given that name;otherwise, BLANK is used.Normally, the ERASE command double-checks to be sure you want to erase a disk.If the -C flag is used, the ERASE command does not double-check before erasingthe volume.By default, the ProDOS FST format is used.  You can override this default byspecifying an FST by number.  Of course, GS/OS must support the FST numberyou select.Parameters:     -C         Don't check before erasing the disk.     device     Device number (i.e. .D1) of the device to initialize.  A volume                name may be used if the disk has already been initialized.     FST        File System Translator number.     name       Name to assign to the new disk.
