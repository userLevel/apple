NEWER [-C] file fileListThe modification date for the first file (file) is read and saved.  A wildcardcan be used for the first file, but only the first matching file will be used.All files in fileList are then scanned.  Wildcards may be used in any file inthis file list.  If any file in the file list is more recent than the firstfile, NEWER sets {Status} to 1.  If all files in the file list are at least asold as the first file, NEWER sets {Status} to 0.If the -C flag is set NEWER compares creation dates instead of modificationdates.Parameters:     -C         Compare creation dates.     file       File to check.     fileList   List of files to compare with file.
