DETOKE [-P] [-V] file1 ...One or more file names, which may use wildcards, are scanned.  Any files thatare GSoft BASIC tokenized source files are converted to ORCA SRC files.  Theoutput file name is formed by adding ".bas" to the GSoft BASIC file name; ifthe GSoft BASIC file name exceeds 11 characters, it is truncated.  If a filealready exists with the output file name, it is not replaced unless it is aSRC file.Parameters:     -P         Print progress information.     -V         Print the version number and copyright information.     file1 ...  Source files to convert.
