TCMP [-B] [-F] [-I] [-N] [-S n ] [-V] [-W] file1 file2Compares file1 to file2.  If the files are identical, a message to that affectis printed, and the return code is zero. If an error occurs, or if the filesdiffer, the return code is set to -1.If a difference is found, the lines that differ are written to standard out.TCMP is capable of detecting inserted lines, including entire insertedsubroutines.  Once a difference is found, it requires five lines to matchbefore it considers the files to be in syncronization, and stops printinglines as mismatches.There must be enough memory to hold both files in memory at one time.Parameters:     -B         Ignore leading blanks.     -F         Fold uppercase into lowercase.     -I         Ignore non-printing characters.     -N         Print line numbers of mismatches.     -S n       Resyncronize after n lines match.     -V         Print version number and copyright.     -W         Runs of white space compare equal.     file1      First file to compare.     file2      Second file to compare.
