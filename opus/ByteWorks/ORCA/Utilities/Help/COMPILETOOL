COMPILETOOL [-L] [-P] [-V] filenameConverts a text tool interface file to the binary form used by GSoft BASIC.The output file name is formed by stripping any dot extension from thefilename, then adding .gst. For example, if filename is GSoftTools.int, theoutput file will be named GSoftTools.gst.If the -L flag is set, the tool interface file is listed as it is processed.If this flag is not set, only lines that generate errors will be listed.The -P flag causes COMPILETOOL to write progress information.The -V flag causes COMPILETOOL to write its version number and copyrightnotice just before is starts to process the file.Parameters:     -L         List the source file as it is processed.     -P         Write progress information.     -V         Write version and copyright information.     filename   Input file.
