	keep	Hello	mcopy Hello.mac******************************************************************  Hello, world.**  This is the classic "first" program.	 It simply prints*  the string "Hello, world." to the screen.  It shows the*  absolute minimum you need to do for a working program:**  1.	The data bank register (B register) should be set to*	point to your program so that absolute addressing will*	work.*  2.	Before returning to the shell, the A register should*	be set to an error value.  If there is no error,*	return 0.  If the error is a tool error, return the*	error number returned by the tool.  If the error is*	specific to your program, return -1 ($FFFF).*  3.	Return to the shell with an RTL.  You can also use*	a ProDOS Quit call, which takes more time and space,*	but works for S16 programs, too.  (S16 programs can*	be launched by the finder.)******************************************************************Hello	start	phk	plb	jsl	SystemEnvironmentInit	jsl	SysIOStartup	puts	#'Hello world.',cr=t	jsl	SysIOShutDown	lda	#0	rtl	end
