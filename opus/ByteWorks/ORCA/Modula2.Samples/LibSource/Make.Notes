This folder contains some of the files needed to build the Modula-2 library file, M2Lib.  The remainder of the files are in the definition files folder.To recompile these libraries, follow these steps:1.  Copy all of the files from the folder M2Interfaces into the folder def.  M2Interfaces was originally located on the M2.Extras disk, and was copied into your library folder when you installed ORCA/Modula-2.  Def is a folder in this folder.2.  Compile the first set of files by running the script Make.  THis script will stop two times and ask you to copy a key name; be sure and copy it exactly.3.  Edit the file asm:storage.asm and search for the string Storage__Initialisation.  (Note the Australian spelling!)  This is the initialization subroutine for the Storage module.  Replace the name of the subrouine (to the left of the START directive) with the key you copied down that starts with the letters Storage__.4.  Edit the file asm:m2lib.asm and search for the string M2Lib__Initialisation.    This is the initialization subroutine for the M2Lib module.  Replace the name of the subrouine with the key you copied down that starts with the letters M2Lib__.5.  Recmpile the remaining files by running the script Make2.
