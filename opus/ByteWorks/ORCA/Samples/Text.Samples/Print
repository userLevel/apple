!---------------------------------------------------------------!!  Print!!  This program shows how to use the .PRINTER device from!  Pascal.  Programs that use the .PRINTER device will work!  when booted from any system disk version 5.0 or later that!  has the .PRINTER device installed.!!  Be sure your printer is turned on before running this!  program - some kinds of printers will hang if you try to!  print to them when they are not on.  (If this happens,!  turn off the printer and the computer, then turn both!  back on before retrying.)!!  By Mike Westerfield!!  Copyright 1991, 1998!
