Editor 2.1.0Copyright 1996, Byte Works Inc.Thanks to all of you who took the time to report the bugs you found.  I've tried to give credit by listing the people who first reported the bug.  I've used screen names if that's what you used to report the bug.I'd also like to single out David Wallis, who volunteered to wade through all of the online editor bug reports.  His work in creating a comprehensive list of bugs was an immense help in fixing bugs for this release.-- Change List --------------------------------------------------------------2.1.0       1.	Bugs squashed.  See bug notes, below.	    2.	The editor now saves the cursor position, selection, insert		mode, return mode, tab fill mode, and tab line in a resource		fork, loading the information when a file is opened.2.0.1       1.	Bugs squashed.  See bug notes, below.-- Bugs from Editor 2.0.1 that are fixed in 2.0.2 ---------------------------1.  When in insert mode and auto-indent mode, pressing return at the top of a blank file hung the editor.(Jay Krell, AFC SteveB; special thanks to Jay who first found a way to reproduce this bug reliably.)2.  Attempting to use the mouse to select a dialog "button" in the Replace command's dialog hung the editor.  The same underlying problem was found in a few other places, too.The editor only supports the mouse in certain limited places; it now ignores mouse actions while the Replace dialog is visible.(David Wallis)3.  In some cases, an out of memory error would occur while saving a file, and the editor would infinite loop, continuously displaying the same error message.  The infinite loop has been corrected, but keep in mind that if an out of memory error occurs during a save, the file has not been saved to disk.  You are left in the editor, though, so you can take other actions (like closing windows) and try again.(Peter Watson)4.  A nasty memory leak has been corrected.  This leak would frequently reserve file-size blocks of memory when editing caused a file buffer to grow.5.  A crash bug in the mouse routines has been corrected.  This bug would cause crashes when the mouse and keyboard were used at nearly the same time.-- Bugs from Editor 2.0.0 that are fixed in 2.0.1 ---------------------------1.  The keypad no longer acts like the open-apple key is pressed down.(DavidW271, et. al.)
