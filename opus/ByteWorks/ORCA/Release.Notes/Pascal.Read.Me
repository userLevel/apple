Welcome to ORCA/Pascal 2.2.0! I want to thank you for helping us continue to support the Apple IIGS by voting for support with your purchase of this upgrade.There have been dozens of changes between this version and the original release of ORCA/Pascal 2.0. To keep the upgrade price low, we have not changed the manual.  Instead, you'll find detailed lists of the changes in the folder named Release.Notes.  These changes are generally organized by executable program, so linker changes are documented in Linker.notes, and editor changes are documented in Editor.notes.  The exception is Pascal.notes, which also contains updates to the documentation itself.Each file starts with an index describing the various changes.  After the index, you will find two distinct kinds of information, although each file doesn't necessarily contain both kinds.  The first is a detailed list of bug fixes.  Unless you're looking for a particular problem, you can generally ignore that information.  The other is documentation corrections and descriptions of new features.  You should scan each of the files in Release.notes for this kind of information.Over the years, I have tried very hard to make ORCA/Pascal work on a minimal Apple IIGS configuration--1.25M of RAM and one or two 3.5" floppy disks.  With the release of System 6.0.1, I even went so far as to create special, small versions of the compilers to make up for the increase in memory requirements by the system software.  Unfortunately, experience shows that it wasn't enough.  With this release, I've stopped trying.  It is no longer possible to run the desktop version of ORCA/Pascal without 1.75M of RAM, and a hard disk is required for any toolbox programming.Fortunately, hard drives cost as little as $95 and 4 megabytes of RAM is generally under $130, so upgrading your Apple IIGS is a more reasonable option than it was when the computer was new.  We don't sell hard drives or RAM cards, but we know several reliable companies that do.  If you want to upgrade your Apple IIGS and need help tracking down companies, give us a call.If you are doing text based programming you can still run ORCA/Pascal from an Apple IIGS with 1.25M of RAM, and you can fit all of ORCA/Pascal you need on a single 3.5" floppy disk.  The installer has an option to install a text-only system.  Use that installer option to create your text system.Everyone else--even those who do not use the desktop development system--should install the full ORCA system using the installer scripts for a new system or for updating an existing system.  If you know enough about ORCA to figure out what you can do without, you can go back and delete the utilities, samples and help files you don't want.If you have any questions about ORCA/Pascal, please get in touch.  The file Tech.Support tells how.And thanks again for helping us support the Apple IIGS!Mike Westerfield
