Please let me know whether you want me to include such a message.  (If I do _not_ hear from you, I will assume you _do_ want credit.)Bugs Fixed in the 1.0.2 Release-------------------------------1. Both the CDA and Control Panel for the .PRINTER driver write the initialization string as a p-string, but the .PRINTER driver reads a c-string. The .PRINTER driver has been changed to read a c-string.(Bob Eckweiler)
