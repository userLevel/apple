**  This file builds the sample xcmd.pas.***  There's nothing special about the compile -- just be sure the program*  itself uses the xcmd directive, the small memory model, and does not use the*  segment directive.*compile xcmd.pas**  The -x flag is crutial!  XCMDs must consist of a single segment, and*  without the -x flag on the link, the linker creates an expressload*  segment.*link -x xcmd keep=xcmd**  The Rez compiler packs the executable code and a name into a file for*  HyperCard.*compile xcmd.rez keep=Beep
