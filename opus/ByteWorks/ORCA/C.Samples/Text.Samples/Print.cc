/*******************************************************************  Text Printer Demo**  This example shows how to access the .PRINTER text printer*  driver from a C program.  The .PRINTER driver must be installed*  before this sample is executed.**  There really isn't much to this sample, which may seem bad at*  first, but it's really good:  accessing the text printer driver*  really is as simple as opening the printer and writing to it!**  By Mike Westerfield**  Copyright 1993*  Byte Works, Inc.*                                 *****************************************************************/#pragma keep "Print"#pragma lint -1#include <stdio.h>void main (void){FILE *f;f = fopen(".printer", "w+");fprintf(f, "Hello, printer!\n");fputc('\f', f);			/* on most printers, this will eject a page */fclose(f);}
