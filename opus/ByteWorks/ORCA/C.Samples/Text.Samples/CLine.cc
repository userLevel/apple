/*****************************************************************  Command Line**  On the Apple IIgs, all EXE programs can expect three things*  to be passed to them by the shell: a user ID number for use*  with tool kits, an eight character shell ID which*  identifies the shell that executed the program, and the*  text from the command line itself.  This program shows how*  to access these values from C, printing them to the*  screen.  Be sure and execute the program with some text*  after the name - for example,**       CLINE Hello, world.**  When any EXE program returns to the shell, it passes an*  error code in the A register.  You can set this value from*  C by returning an integer value as the result of main, as*  shown in this program.**  If you compile this program from the desktop, turn debug*  code off before executing the program from the shell window.****************************************************************/#pragma keep "CLine"#pragma lint -1#include <stdio.h>#include <orca.h>int main(void){char *shellName, *line;int userNumber;userNumber = userid();shellName = shellid();line = commandline();printf("User ID: %d\n", userNumber);printf("Shell ID: %s\n", shellName);printf("Command line: %s\n", line);return 0;}
