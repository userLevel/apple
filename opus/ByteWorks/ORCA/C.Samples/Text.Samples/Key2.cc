/*******************************************************************   Keyboard Handling**   This program demonstrates separate compilation by splitting*   the program KEY into two parts: the main program, and a*   separately compiled file with the keyboard subroutines that*   can then be called from many different programs without the*   need for recompiling.  See KEY.CC for a full description of*   what this program does.**   The program now consists of four files:**        Key2.Build - EXEC file which separately compiles the two*                     source files, then links their object*                     modules to create the final program.  To*                     use the EXEC file, simply type KEY2.BUILD*                     from the command line.**        Key2.cc    - File containing main program.**        Key2.h     - Header file accessed by the main program;*                     Contains declarations of external functions.**        Key2.Funcs - File containing keyboard functions called*                     by main program.**   See Key3 for a version that uses assembly language to read*   the keyboard.**   By Mike Westerfield and Barbara Allred**   Copyright 1987-1989*   Byte Works, Inc.********************************************************************/#pragma keep "Key2"#pragma lint -1#include "Key2.h"#include <stdio.h>int main(void){char ch;printf ("Press any key(s) and then RETURN.
