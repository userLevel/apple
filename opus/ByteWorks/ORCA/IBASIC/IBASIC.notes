See bug notes, below.--- Bugs in version 1.0.1 that were fixed in version 1.0.2 --------------------1.  The INPUT statement failed under versions of the ORCA library that use the .CONSOLE driver.  These include versions of SysLib beginning with ORCA/M 2.0.1, ORCA/C 2.0, ORCA/Pascal 2.0 and ORCA/Modula-2 1.0.  The startup and shutdown code has been changed to support the new I/O system; it will not work with the old one.(Joyce Sullivan)2.  Imbedding a GOSUB inside a FOR loop that calls a subroutine which also has a FOR loop confused the compiler.  It would use the same memory location for both FOR loops.(Jay Krell)
