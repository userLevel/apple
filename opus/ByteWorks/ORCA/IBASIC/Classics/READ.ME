   Welcome to Integer BASIC Classics!  Those of you who have been around theApple II world for a decade or so may recognize many of these programs.  Ihope you enjoy them as much as I have!   This disk is a spin off of a project at the Byte Works which produced anInteger BASIC compiler.  It may seem pretty crazy to write an Integer BASICcompiler after all these years, but we did have our reasons.  The Integer BASICcompiler is designed to show people how to write a compiler; how to use some ofthe ideas in a compiler in other programs, like spelling checkers, adventuregames, and so on; and how to make a language work smoothly in the ORCA/APWlanguage environment that has become the standard for the Apple IIGS.   Along the way, something strange happened.  When I originally showed IntegerBASIC to folks at KansasFest in 1990, I got a variety of reactions.  Some oldhands in the Apple world immediately wanted to port Lemonade and other clasicsto the GS.  A lot of folks just laughed with glee at such a crazy program.  Afew wondered off, shaking their heads.  Overall, though, I was surprised at howmany people really liked the idea of this little demonstration compiler.  Overnew next few months, I got several phone calls from people who wanted to knowwhen I was going to sell it!  Well, heck -- I'm in business to sell programs,after all, so I couldn't pass up requests like that!   As a part of the project that turned Integer BASIC into a real product, Iraided in AppleQuerque computer club's public domain library, and carted offa few disks worth of old Integer BASIC programs.  This disk is a distillationof some of those programs -- mostly the ones that would work in a compiledenvironment without too much effort on my part.  There are some real gems here,as well as a number of lemons, but one of the things I learned when I was aclub librarian was that one persons gems are another persons garbage, so Ididn't throw out much.  It's fun to look through the source, as well as runthe programs.  You may be amazed at just how much can be done with lowresolution graphics and a very simple language.  You might also be amazed atsome of the names you recognize.  A lot of famous folks got their start inInteger BASIC!  Just for kicks, you might start with MasterWoz, written by noneother than the Woz himself, creator of the Apple II.   All of the source code on this disk is public domain.  The compiled programscontain copyrighted subroutines from the Integer BASIC subroutine library,published by the Byte Works.

In short, give this disk to anyonewho owns an Apple IIGS.  The programs can be executed in their current formfrom ORCA/M, APW, and most other text enviornments.   If you are interested in the compiler that compiles these programs, contactthe publisher:        Byte Works, Inc.        4700 Irving Blvd. N.W.
