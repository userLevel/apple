Bugs squashed.  See bug notes, below.-- Bugs from Quick Click Morph 1.0 that have been fixed ---------------------1. The "OK" button was missing from the Decrypt dialog.(Christopher Heck)2. The error message displayed when mismatching passwords were entered was not correct.(Christopher Heck)3. The rightmost and bottommost scroll bar positions were off by one pixel.(Christopher Heck)4. Moving a multi-palette window did not update the line-by-line palette map (the SCB table, for the technically inclined).(Christopher Heck)5. After using the Morph This Frame command, the second key frame was displayed.  This has been changed so the newly morphed frame is displayed.(Christopher Heck)6. Morhing didn't work while a key frame pair was displayed.(Christopher Heck)7. The grayscales stolen to display the morph points in green and red have been changed to gray colors 1,1,1 and 2,2,2, which produces a less noticable difference in the visible picture.(Christopher Heck)8. Changing the number of tween frames did not adjust the fade intensities, so frames would have a noticibly bad color mix.  (Setting the fade kind, i.e. Fast In Fast Out, would force the fade intensities to be updated.)(Dirk Froehling)-- Bugs from Quick Click Movie 1.0 that have been fixed ---------------------1. The Save As... dialog had an unused encrypt button.  This has been removed.(Christopher Heck)
