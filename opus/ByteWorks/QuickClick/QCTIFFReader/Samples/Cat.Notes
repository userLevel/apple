The picture in this folder, called Cat, is the original, unretouched photograph that was used for the KarenCat morph in Quick Click Morph.The picture was created with a QuickTake 100 digital camera.  The QuickTake software was used to save the unretouched image as a TIFF file, and the file was moved to a ProDOS disk.  The file has been loaded one time with Quick Click TIFF Reader to fix the file type stamp, but other than changing the file type, nothing else has been done to the picture.If you've seen the finished KarenCat morph, you know a number of changes were made to the picture.  The background was cut out with a Paint program in the version used for the morph.  Looking at the raw image, you'll also see that the picture has too much green (a typical problem with the QuickTake camera when used indoors) and not enough contrast.  These are exactly the kinds of problems yu can fix with Quick Click TIFF Reader!
