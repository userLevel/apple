Quick Click Calc 1.3.1Copyright 1994-1996 Byte Works Inc.-- Thanks to... -------------------------------------------------------------All of the folks whose names are enshrined in parenthesis below specific changes and bug fixes.  These are the people who reported problems in ways I could duplicate them, goaded me into making changes, and in general helped create a better product for you to use!-- Change List --------------------------------------------------------------1.3.1	    1.	Bugs squashed.  See bug notes, below.1.3	    1.	Bugs squashed.  See bug notes, below.	    2.	There is now a preference setting that controls whether the		left and right arrow keys move to a new cell or move the		cursor in the formula entry box.  See "Preferences," below,		for details.		(Philippe Manet)	    3.	The Round function now supports negative digits to round to		the left of the decimal point.  For example, Round(123.456, -1)		is 120.		(Jeff Bartsch)1.2         1.	Bugs squashed.  See bug notes, below.	    2.	Support added for the international character set (e.g.		option-u u).		(David Kerwood)	    3.	Esc is now equivalent to command-Z (undo).		(Bill Rascher)	    4.	Print Selection... command added.  See "Printing," below.		(J. Trotter, William Grasman)	    5.  Formats work on blank cells.  See "Formatting Blank Cells,"		below.		(J. Trotter)	    6.  The Delete key now works like the Clear menu command whenever		you are not editing text in a cell.		(David Pierce, Skip Helbig)	    7.	Paste will now paste text across spreadsheet cells, not just		into formula boxes.		(William Grasman)	    8.	A new preferences dialog supports many format and input		options.  See "Preferences," below.1.1         1.	Bugs squashed.  See bug notes, below.	    2.	Holding the command key down and pressing an arrow key moves		one page in the indicated direction.		(William Rascher)	    3.	The tab key moves to the right, much like the right arrow		key.  Command-tab moves to the left.		(William Rascher)	    4.	Support has been added for the extended keyboard.  See		"Extended Keyboard Support," below.		(PowerPC.Pro)	    5.	The % format option now uses the number of decimal places,		just like Fixed and Dollar did in 1.0.		(Ken Lucke, Alfred Orr, Just.Dave)-- Printing -----------------------------------------------------------------The Print... command has been split into two separate commands.Print Selection... is only active when a spreadsheet window with selected cells is frontmost.  It works pretty much like Print..., but only prints the selected cells.Print... still exists.  The Print... command works as before when a chart or notes window is frontmost.  When a spreadsheet window is frontmost, the Print... command used to print only the selected cells when any cells were selected, and would print the entire spreadsheet if no cells were selected.  The new Print... command always prints all cells in the spreadsheet.-- Formatting Blank Cells ---------------------------------------------------You can now select blank cells and apply formatting (such as color, borders, fonts and attributes) to both existing and blank cells.  The formatting for a blank cell remains in effect until you change the formatting for a given cell manually, or until you change the default format for the entire spreadsheet by deselecting all cells and sellecting a format.-- Extended Keyboard Support ------------------------------------------------The labeled keys on the extended keyboard now map to reasonable equivalents in Quick Click Calc.  The keys supported, and their equivalents, are:	key			command	---			-------	f1 (undo)		Undo	f2 (cut)		Cut	f3 (copy)		Copy	f4 (paste)		Paste	f13 (print screen)	Print Window...	ins (help)		Insert cell or row	del			Delete cell or row	home			Show selected cell	end			Last Cell	page up			equivalent to command-up arrow	page down		equivalent to command-down arrow	clear			Clear-- Preferences --------------------------------------------------------------The Options menu has a new command, Preferences..., which is not described in the manual.  This command brings up a preferences dialog that allows you to select several input and output options.For U.S. users, there are two options that are likely to be of interest.The first is the input options, which can be used to disable conversion of date and grade strings.  For example, by default entering A into a cell generates the number 4, which is the numeric value for the letter grade A.The second option of general interest is "Use arrows as...," which controls how the left and right arrow keys are used when you are editing a function.  If you select "Cell movement keys" the left and right arrow keys finish the entry of the current function (just as if you pressed the Enter key) then move either one cell to the right or left, depending on the key you pressed.  This is the behavior these kays have exibited in earlier versions of Quick Click Calc.  If you select "Formula edit keys" these keys will move the cursor in the function entry box--but ONLY if you are already editing a function.  If you are not editing the function, the keys still move to a new cell.The remaining options are generally used outside the U.S., where different formats are used for money, writing numbers, and the order of dates.  I hope these are self explanatory, so I won't discuss the dialog in detail here.  A little experimenting should resolve any questions.-- Bugs from Quick Click Calc 1.3 that have been fixed in 1.3.1 -------------1. Some kinds of forward references were not updated correcly, leading to eronious results in the spreadsheet.(Ken Wong)2. In some situations, the bottom or right scroll bar in a split screen control was created incorrectly, showing scroll bar arrows and a thumb that extended all the way between them, and yielding an inoperative scroll bar.(Ken Wong)3. With multiple font sizes, some sequences of events would cause improper areas to be inverted in the formula edit box.(Ken Wong)-- Bugs from Quick Click Calc 1.2 that have been fixed in 1.3 ---------------1. A format could be created for blank cells, but when the spreadsheet was saved and later loaded, the format was not retained.(J.Gronvall)2. When the preference is selected to use commas rather than a period for the decimal point, formulas are displayed in the formula entry box using commas, but these commas must be manually changed to periods before the edited formula is accepted by Quick Click Calc.Switching to commas in the display causes a conflict with the comma character used to separate arguments in a function.The solution used in Quick Click Calc is:   a. You can use either a comma or a period as the decimal point in a numeric constant.  Numeric constants are displayed in the formula entry box as they were typed.  In cells, they are displayed using the active preference.   b. Formulas must be entered using the same convention as the active preference.  They are always displayed using the active preference.  If the preference is for a period as the decimal point, function arguments are separated by commas.  If the preference is for a comma as the decimal point, function arguments are separated by semicolons.(Philippe Manet)3. Quick Click Calc supports non-ASCII keys using key translation tables.  Following Apple's guidelines, Quick Click Calc 1.2 set the key translation table to "Standard" on entry, and reset it to the original value on exit.  Unfortunately, this meant anyone who deliberately selected a non-US keyboard translator could not use it in Quick Click Calc.Quick Click Calc 1.3 will only change the keyboard translation if the original setting is "None."  The setting is still reset on exit.  If you have selected some keyboard translator that does not support all of the extended characters, yo may not be able to see them--but presumably, if you selected a specific translator, you knew what you were getting.(Bernard Huber, Yvan KOENIG)4. Row lengths in AppleWorks 3.0 spreadsheets were interpreted incorectly.  Sometimes this didn't cause a problem, but other times it caused Quick Click Calc to hang position rows strangely when importing AppleWorks spreadsheets.(Christopher Beckett)5. When importing AppleWorks 3.0 spreadsheets, Quick Click Calc did not always anticipate the space needed for a cell correctly, leading to memory corruption problems.(Rip Ash, Ray Reedy, Maxwell Campbell)6. In expressions, the tokens <=, <> and >= ate the character after the token.  Unless you followed these tokens with a space, you would get a spurious syntax error or an incorrect function result.(Maxwell Campbell)7. Bar charts with minimum Y values over zero, or with bars that extended below the axis, were drawn over the chart labels.  Any bar that does not extend above the axis is no longer drawn.(Jim Pittman)8. In some cases involving large numbers of cells plotted close together, mathematical overflow errors caused missing cell labels along the X axis of a chart.  This problem has been corrected.(Phil Albro)9. Date constants of the form "25 December 1994" are now accepted as input.(Yvan Koenig)10. Strings containing extended characters, such as "Dec" with an accented e, compare correctly.  The main effect of this bug was to cause French and German date strings to compare incorrectly for months names that used extended characters.(Yvan Koenig)11. Some kinds of circular references could cause an infinite loop when a cell invovled in the circular reference was updated.(Richard Oravecz)12. Some functions did not display an error when the function operated on a cell range that had an offsheet cell.  (Offsheet cells in a range are generally caused by deleting the end cell in the range.)13. A speed bottleneck in row and column inserts and deletes has been eliminated.(JB Wilson)14. Inserting or deleting a row or column, then performing some other operation, caused infinite loops or continuous sluggish operation in some cases.(JB Wilson, Don V. Zahniser, Jonathan Levenson)15. Wide cell borders were not drawn correctly on the bottom or right when the adjacent cell was occupied.(Michael Nickolas)16. AND and OR did not scan to their closing parenthesis if an earlier argument determined the result of the entire function.  This caused problems when AND or OR were used in expressions, and were not the last term in the expression.For example,	if(and(B2, C2), D2, E2)would give a bogus result if B2 was 0, since AND would not look at C2, leaving it around for the if expression to use (and get confused over).(Maxwell Campbell)17. The IF statement would not return strings as results from label cells.  Forexample,	if(1, D2, E2)would return 0 if D2 contained the label "true", even though it should return the string "true".(Maxwell Campbell)18. In some cases, cells appearing in the rightmost column of a printed page were not printed correctly.(Dr. Julius L. Levy)19. With variable width or height cells, scrolling did not always draw the rightmost or bottommost cell correctly.20. Some kinds of errors importing ASCII files would cause memory corruption.(Steve Glick)21. Three error dialogs had default actions corresponding to the dangerous choice--throwing away changes or changing occupied cells by default.  The default has been changed to the safe action.(Udo Huth)22. Scrolling up used to take much longer than scrolling down.  Some speed improvements now make it just as fast.(Jonathan Levenson)-- Bugs from Quick Click Calc 1.1 that have been fixed in 1.2 ---------------1. Cells in the gray "dead" area outside the range of the spreadsheet cannot be selected.(Bill Harris)2. Cells from a spreadsheet could overwrite the scroll bars.  This happened when the screen was split horizontally, and the cell to the right of the split was empty, and the first non-empty cell to the left of the empty cell was a cell label.(Ken Lucke, Bill Rascher, Alfred Orr, William Grasman)3. When copying and pasting cells, in some cases the cell formula adjustment code would do strange things to the formula.(Halbert Wright, Ken Lucke, J.Gronvall, Alfred Orr)4. Lowercase umlaut-a (chr(138), obtained by typing option-u a) was interpreted as a down arrow key.  The same problem probably occurred with other international characters.(Dirk Froehling)5. Importing AppleWorks 3.0 files generally failed.  Several bugs in this area have been fixed.(Alan Westwell, Alfred Orr, Bill Rascher, Peter Hinchlif, Stephen Hill)6. Select-All followed by Delete trashed the column width array, causing either a strange display or a hang.7. Comparisons of strings result in a number, and should be legal wherever a number is needed.  In particular,    if (SubStr(D12, 1, 1) = "Y", ...out to work.  Now it does.(W. Rascher)8. The window name shown in the Windows menu was not updated immediately after using Save As... to save a file.(Eric Shepherd, Bill Harris)9. The titles for the chart dialog were incorrect when you select a column of cells and create a new chart.  Everything worked correctly, but the edlitline box labels were set for rows, not columns.(Eric Shepherd)10. Shaddowed bars for negative values were not drawn correctly.(Eric Shepherd)11. Expressions that used a string function result from another cell, such as	if(B3=B4, 1, 0)where cells B3 and B4 contained the Month function, did not calculate correctly.(Bill Harris)12. An if statement that contained two string results, such as	if(C4, "True", "False")always displayed the last string.(J.Gronvall)13. After trying to edit a protected cell, you were locked in--the cell couldn't be edited, but neither could you leave the cell.  The only alternative was to deprotect the cell.  Now, the editing is rejected and you can move on.(Bob Kontratenko)14. The watch cursor is now displayed during sorts.15. When importing ASCII files, cell ranges of the form A1..C3 are now converted to the QC Calc form of A1:C3.(Gerald Lester, Bill Harris, John Wilson)16. When an error occurs when importing an ASCII file, the cell is now converted to a label and the remaining cells are loaded.(Stephen Hill)17. There were several conditions where cells were not redrawn properly when the cells had borders.  These generally involved moving the cells using the transpose or move command, or deleting the cells.(Bill Harris, Stephen Hill)18. Deprotecting a cell left you in formula entry mode; it now leaves you in cell mode.(Chris Major, Stephen Hill)19. Inserting or deleting rows or columns did not properly update formulas containing ranges of cells that spanned the inserted or deleted material.  For example, the formula   =sum(C3:C7)did not update properly if row 5 was deleted.(Halbert Wright)20. On spreadsheets that contained text in the rightmost cell, scrolling to the right by selecting and dragging a column caused rows ending in text to be highlighted improperly.(Ken Lucke, Halbert Wright)21. The initial cells on the first page of a speadsheet did not always print with the correct font.(Halbert Wright, Alfred Orr, Ken Lucke, Stephen Hill)22. The scroll bar thumb position was set improperly when a spreadsheet was saved, then loaded, with something other than cell A1 at the top left corner.(William Grasman)23. Fill Down and Fill Right did not mark the file as changed, so quitting after using only these operations would not give you a chance to save the changes.24. A file write error (such as saving to a write-protected disk) caused repeated file write errors.  Only one such error occurs now.(Doug Cuff)25. The AVG function did not work when the operand was not a cell range.  For example, AVG(1, 2, 3) returned 1.(John Wilson, John Howard)26. Some completely bogus operands involving cell ranged were not flagged as errors.  For example, AVG(A1:A3 + A5:A9) makes no sense, but was not flagged as an error.27. Blank, selected cells were not redrawn properly after being covered with an error dialog.  (Such cells were not inverted correctly.)(Skip Helbig, Stephen Hill)28. In some dialogs, particularly the dialog that displayed cell errors, the cursor was not changed to an arrow.29. A speed bottleneck has been corrected, and several speed enhancements implemented.30. Circular references were not computed correctly, causing hangs in some cases and not finding circular references that really existed in others.(Don Zahniser, Stephen Hill, William Grasman, John Wilson)31. Using the cancel command with either the Row Height or Cell Width command changed the heights and widths of all cells to match the first cell.(Stephen Hill)32. The OR function did not work on individual arguments separated by commas.  For example,	=Or(True, False)returned 0, when it should return 1.(John Howard)33. Using the cancel command with Cell Attributes... still changed selected cells.34. Using Cell Attributes... on a range of cells that contained some blank cells would sometimes corrupt memory, leading to hangs or crashes.  (Note: This bug occurred in versions 1.2 B3 and 1.2 B4; it did not happen in the 1.1 commercial release.)(Mark Kline, Ken Lucke)-- Bugs from Quick Click Calc 1.0 that have been fixed in 1.1 ---------------1. After operations that changed individual cells (like cut and paste), the new cell values were not consistently displayed.(William Rascher, J.Gronvall, Gerald Lester, Halbert Wright, Robert Kondratenko, Alfred Orr)2. Dragging to change the height of a cell did not work consistently in the lower part of a split display.(Halbert Wright)3. When text overflowed into another cell, it did not print properly.(David Ciotti, J.Gronvall, Alfred Orr, William Grasman)4. Select All followed by Clear or Cut took so long it appeared to hang.  The algorithm has been improved.(J.Gronvall)5. The IF function didn't allow strings as arguments.  For example, the formula	=if(C5=0, 0, "non-zero")is legal, but did not work in version 1.0.(Halbert Wright)6. Shrinking the top row of the spreadsheet so fonts extended above the top row of the visible cell overwrote the black dividing line between the cell titles and the cells.(PowerPC.Pro)7. The range of the scroll bars was not set properly when a file was loaded from disk.  For example, if you changed the size of a spreadsheet to Px100 cells, moving the thumb of the vertical scroll bar to the bottom of the spreadsheet should move to cell 100, and the thumb should remain at the bottom.  This worked until the spreadsheet was saved and reloaded.  In the new version, it works all the time.(Halbert Wright, Ken Lucke)8. You could not open or print Quick Click Calc documents from the Finder.(Gerald Lester)9. In some cases, selecting cells, creating a new chart, and selecting various chart types in 3 dimensions gave inapropriate default settings for the cell ranges in the chart edit dialog.(Ken Lucke)
