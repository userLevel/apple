This disk contains localized versions of Quick Click Calc for France and Germany.Extracting the Localized Version--------------------------------The localized versions are contained in self extracting archives.  Run the appropriate version from the Finder or any other program launcher.  You will be asked where to place the files in the archive.  One possibility is to extract the archive on top of your existing Quick Click Calc program, replacing the English version with the French or German one.Running the Localized Version-----------------------------The localized version has the same name, icon, and command set as the English version.  It is used in exactly the same way.  The only difference is the language used in menus and windows.Changing the Localized Version------------------------------Each version comes with the REZ compiler source file used to create the resource fork.  The resource fork contains all of the text used by Quick Click Calc.If you are familiar with REZ, you can make changes to the resources to suit your needs or preferences.If you do make changes, especially if you create a version of Quick Click Calc for another language, please contact the publisher.  We at the Byte Works are very interested in making Quick Click Calc available in the native language of all of our customers.
