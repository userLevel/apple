Getting Started with GSoft BASIC================================Program, Documentation and DesignCopyright 1998-1999The Byte Works, Inc.(This document is formatted for a monospaced font like Courier.)Contents--------Why the Free Version ExistsSystem RequirementsInstallationDocumentationWhat You Get in the Commercial Version of GSoft BASICUpgrading to the Commercial VersionTechnical SupportDistribution Rights and LimitationsWarrantiesHow to Contact the PublisherWhy the Free Version Exists---------------------------   This free version of GSoft BASIC serves two purposes:  First, it is an advertisement for the full commercial version.  We obviously hope you will like GSoft BASIC enough to buy the commercial package.  Second, we hope that this version will increase the use of GSoft BASIC among those who won't end up buying the commercial version.  The programs and general interest created by that group will help the entire community grow, hopefully creating free or low cost source code that all people who use GSoft BASIC will find useful.System Requirements-------------------Apple IIGS Computer or EmulatorSystem 6.0.11.125M RAMTwo 800K floppy drives or One 800K drive and a hard driveInstallation------------   You can run GSoft BASIC, the FREE Version! directly from a floppy disk by running GSoft.Sys16 from the Finder or any other program launcher.   To install GSoft BASIC, the FREE Version! on your hard drive, create a folder called GSoft on any partition and copy all of the files to the new folder.  Once again, execute GSoft.Sys16 to start GSoft BASIC, the FREE Version!Documentation-------------   The amount and quality of the documentation that we can provide on disk is limited.  If you are familiar with the Apple IIGS computer and with the BASIC language, the documentation included here should be adequate to get you started.  If you are not familiar with BASIC, adding a book from your local library or bookstore should help a lot.  Books that are not intended for a specific version of BASIC will probably be more useful to you than books about a specific implementation.   The documentation on this disk gives a brief overview of the command processor that you use to enter BASIC programs, as well as the commands in GSoft BASIC itself. All of the documentation is in the folder Documentation.  The documentation for the command processor is in the file Shell.txt, while the BASIC language is described in the file BASIC.txt.  These are simple text files that can be viewed and printed with any program that processes text.   GSoft BASIC comes with the same full-screen editor used by the ORCA and APW programming environments.  You enter the editor using the EDIT command.  Once there, use Command-? To view the editor's help screen.  This shows the most commonly used commands.  Of course, you can also type programs directly from the command line if you are willing to use line numbers.   Other sources of documentation that you might find useful include:   * The GSoft BASIC reference manual, included with the commercial version of GSoft BASIC.   * General programming books from your library or bookstore.   * General purpose books about BASIC.These books are available from the Byte Works, publisher's of GSoft BASIC:   * Apple IIGS Toolbox Reference, volumes 1-3   * Programmer's Reference for System 6.0 and 6.0.1   * Apple IIGS GS/OS Reference   * Apple IIGS Firmware Reference   * Apple IIGS Hardware Reference   * Programmer's Introduction to the Apple IIGS   * Technical Introduction to the Apple IIGSThese extensive self-study courses are planned for release in early 1999.  Watch our web site for details, or ask to be placed on our mailing list.   * Learn to Program in GSoft BASIC   * Toolbox Programming in GSoft BASICWhat You Get in the Commercial Version of GSoft BASIC-----------------------------------------------------   While the GSoft BASIC, the FREE Version! is a fine development system, the commercial version certainly adds more features.  Here's a list of the more important additions in the commercial version of the program:   * Manual:  The commercial version includes a 329-page spiral bound manual with an extensive index and table of contents.  This manual includes a brief overview of Apple IIGS programming and extensive documentation of the GSoft BASIC language and programming environment.   * Memory:  GSoft BASIC, the FREE Version! is limited to 16K bytes of program space and 16K bytes of variable space.  The commercial version can use all of available memory for programs and variables.   * MakeRuntime:  Converts any GSoft BASIC program to an S16 program that can run from the Finder or any other program launcher, just like an application created with a compiler or assembler.   * DeToke Utility:  Runs from the ORCA shell, converting GSoft BASIC tokenized programs into ASCII program files.  (You can also do this from GSoft BASIC, the FREE Version! using the TSAVE or SSAVE commands.)   * CompileTool Utility:  Runs from the ORCA shell, compiling tool header files for use by GSoft BASIC.   * User Tools:  You get two user tools, with source code.  TimeTool provides date and time commands, while GameTool gives your programs access to joysticks, game paddles, and other devices that connect to the game paddle port.   * .PRINTER Driver:  This driver lets you print to an ASCII printer from any application that can write files to GS/OS--including GSoft BASIC programs, of course!   * ORCA Version:  A second version of BASIC is included that runs under the powerful ORCA development system.  The ORCA development system is not included; this version is available for use by those who already use ORCA for other kinds of programming.   * Samples:  The commercial version includes a few samples that are too large to run with GSoft BASIC, the FREE Version!Technical Support-----------------   We do not offer technical support for GSoft BASIC, the FREE Version!  If you locate and identify a bug in the software, we will attempt to correct it and make updates available, but we cannot offer one-on-one support of any kind.   Support is available for the commercial version of GSoft BASIC by phone, e-mail or regular mail.  Support is limited to answering specific questions about the software and its use--we cannot offer assistance in writing or debugging your programs.Upgrading to the Commercial Version-----------------------------------   If you would like to upgrade to the commercial version of GSoft BASIC, just let us know!  As this document is written you pay just $60 for the complete commercial package, including the 329-page spiral bound reference manual and all of the extra software that comes with the commercial version.How to Contact the Publisher----------------------------   You can contact the publisher by practically any method but carrier pigeon.
