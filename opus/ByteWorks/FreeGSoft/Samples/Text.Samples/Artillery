!------------------------------------------------!!  Artillery!!  This classic interactive text game lets you!  pick the angle of your artillery gun in!  an attempt to knock out the enemy position.!  The computer picks a secret distance. When!  you fire, you will be told how much you!  missed by, and must fire again. The object!  is to hit the target with the fewest shells.!!------------------------------------------------!BLASTRADIUS = 50.0			:! max distance from target for a hitDTR = 0.01745329			:! convert from degrees to radiansVELOCITY = 434.6			:! muzzle velocity!! choose a distance to the target!distance = RND(1)*5900.0!! not done yet...!done = 0tries = 1!! shoot 'til we hit it!DO  !  ! get the firing angle  !  INPUT "Firing angle: "; ANGLE  !  ! compute the muzzle velocity in x, y  !  angle = angle*DTR  vx = COS(angle)*VELOCITY  vy = SIN(angle)*VELOCITY  !  ! find the time of flight   !
