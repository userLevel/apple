                          Using the KeyboardIf you do not have a mouse or joystick Byte Paint will also use the keyboard.In fact it is often easier to edit character sets with the keyboard.  Thearrow keys are used to move the cursor across the screen.  The closed applekey will cause the cursor to move faster.  The open apple key substitutes forthe mouse button.
