                             Menu BarThe menu bar is the bar across the top of the screen.  The first menu is thehelp menu that you are reading.  The next is the disk menu.  It lets youload and save pictures; delete files; catalog the disk and load and saveshape tables.The third menu contains the edit aids.  From there you can cut; delete andpaste shapes.  You can also save a cut shape to any one of the 255 positionsin the shape table.  Shapes can be moved from the shape table to the pasteposition using the "get" option.  The "set brush" option lets you selectone of the sixteen shapes for the paint brush.The last thing on the menu bar is "quit".  It isn't really a menu.  Selectingquit returns you to the main menu.
