MON+ 4.1                                                         Copyright 198815 June 1988                                                   MicroSeeds, Inc.===============================================================================MON+ On 40 Columns------------------A special 40 column version of MON+ has been added to this release for thoseof you using the forty column driver included with the latest version ofORCA/M.If you want to use the forty column version, there are two ways to setup your system:Forty Columns OnlyIf you will not be using the eighty column version at all, copy DEBUG40 toyour utility directory, then rename it to be DEBUG.  After that, installDEBUG as a command, as described in the MON+ documentation.Forty and Eighty ColumnsIt is possible to install both versions.  To do this, copy both DEBUG andDEBUG40 to your utility prefix, then install both DEBUG and DEBUG40 as utilitynames.  When you want to execute the forty column version, use the commandDEBUG40, and, of course, simply use DEBUG for the eighty column version.On Line Help------------If you use the on line help facility in ORCA, copy the file called DEBUG.HELPto the HELP subdirectory of the utility prefix, and rename it to be DEBUG.Memeory Use-----------This release of MON+ has been updated to work on the Apple IIGS and Apple //c.In addition to changing some code that depended on older versions of theF8 ROM, we had to change the location of MON+'s stack to avoid collisions withApple's firmware.The documentation for MON+ states that it uses $100 to $11F as its privatestack area.  This has been changed to $120 to $13F, with Apple's firmwaremaking use of some of the memory below $120.  Your programs must not modifythese areas of memory.
