28 June 1988Mike Westerfield----------------The make file in this directory builds the two versions of MON+.  The standardversion, called DEBUG, is designed to work on 80 column screens.  The alternateversion, called DEBUG40, works on 40 column screens.  DEBUG is created byassembling MON, while DEBUG40 is created by assembling MON40.  The onlydifference between the two files is the KEEP name and the setting of the globalvariable TYPE80.  Both versions use MON2 as the second file.This version of MON+ has been changed to work on the Apple IIGS.Software used for the build:----------------------------ORCA/M 1.1 (Apple IIGS version)LINKER 1.1
