SET  variable  valueORCA uses several predeclared variables to control the action of the system.The SET command allows these values to be changed:        SET  SYSTEM  directory - Changes the system prefix to directory.  The                                 system prefix is where ORCA looks for the                                 monitor, editor, command table, editor macro                                 file, and editor tab file.  The default is                                 boot/SYSTEM, where boot is the name of the                                 prefix where ORCA.SYSTEM was executed from.        SET  LANGUAGES  directory - Changes the languages prefix to directory.                                    The languages prefix is where ORCA looks                                    for the linker, assembler, and compilers.                                    The default is boot/LANGUAGES.        SET  LIBRARIES  directory - Changes the libraries prefix to directory.                                    The libraries prefix is where the linker                                    looks for unresolved labels.  The default                                    is boot/LIBRARIES.        SET  UTILITIES  directory - Changes the utilities prefix to directory.                                    The utilities directory is where ORCA                                    looks for utilities.  The subdirectory                                    named HELP, located in the utilities                                    directory, is where the help command looks                                    for help files.  The default is                                    boot/UTILITIES.        SET  WORK  directory - Changes the work prefix to directory.  The work                               prefix is used by ORCA for temporary files.                               The default is boot/WORK.        SET  CLICK  ON|OFF - If click is ON, the console driver clicks the                             speaker when a key is pressed.  Defaults to OFF.        SET  WAIT  ON|OFF -  If wait is ON, the console driver checks to see                             if a key has been pressed when a carriage return                             is written.  If a key has been pressed, it waits                             until another key is pressed before returning                             control to the program that wrote the carriage                             return.  Defaults to ON.        SET  PRINTERSLOT  number - The slot where the printer driver will look                                   for the printer is changed to number, which                                   must be in the range 1 to 7.  The default                                   is slot 1.        SET  PRINTERINIT  string - The string sent to the printer to                                   initialize it is changed to string.  String                                   may be omitted, in which case nothing is                                   sent to initialize the printer.  Control                                   characters can be coded in the string by                                   preceding an ASCII character by a ~.  For                                   example, the default string of CTRL-I 80N                                   would be coded as  ~I80N.
