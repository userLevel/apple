MACGEN [+C] [-C] fileFile is the name of an assembly language source file.  The utility scansfile, producing a list of all of the macros used in the program.  It thenprompts for an output file name.  Finally, it prompts for the names ofmacro library files to search to find the macros needed.  The search stopswhen all macros have been found or the RETURN key is used when a macro fileis requested.Normally, the generated macro file has all excess spaces removed to savespace.  If -C is specified, the excess spaces are not removed.Parameters:     +C|-C      Crunch macros flag.     file       Source file to scan.
